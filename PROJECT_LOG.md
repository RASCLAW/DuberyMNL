# DuberyMNL Project Log

Running log of progress across all workflows. Updated at each session closeout.

## Pipeline Overview
```
WF1 Caption Gen → Review → WF2 Image Gen → WF3a Organic FB Post
                                          → WF3b Meta Ads (parallel)
```

## WF1 — Caption Generation
**Status: COMPLETE**
- 15 captions/batch, 7-8 vibes, 1-2 per vibe
- Bundle quota: 3, elevated tone: 2-3
- Output: Google Sheet (captions tab)

## Caption Review Server
**Status: COMPLETE (pending RA review of 25 captions)**
- Flask app, runs locally via ngrok tunnel
- Star ratings, notes, product recommendations (cascading dropdowns)
- Rejected rows auto-move to rejected_captions tab
- Relaunch: `bash tools/captions/start_review.sh`
- 25 PENDING captions in sheet -- RA to review in one sitting

## WF2 — Image Generation
**Status: SKILLS BUILT — READY FOR TEST RUN**
- Architecture confirmed: Claude Code composes NB2 prompt → generate_kie.py → upload → write_sheet
- Prompt format: labeled sections (SCENE, PRODUCT INSTRUCTION, SUBJECTS, BRANDING, TEXT OVERLAYS)
- Reference images passed via `image_input` array to kie.ai (no Pillow overlay needed)
- 5 content types: TYPE A (PERSON+PRODUCT), B/C (minimal), D (PRODUCT HERO), E (INFOGRAPHIC)
- 14 product reference image URLs documented in dubery-prompt-writer skill
- Skills built: dubery-caption-gen + dubery-prompt-writer (audited, production-ready)
- Next action: update workflows/image_generation.md → test run with one real caption

## WF3a — Organic Facebook Post
**Status: NOT STARTED**
- Tool: tools/meta/post_to_page.py (to be built)
- Inputs: approved caption + generated image
- Requires: pages_manage_posts permission (pending Meta app approval)

## WF3b — Meta Ads
**Status: NOT STARTED**

## Session Log

### 2026-03-10 (Session 1 -- from work via VSCode tunnel)
- EA second brain initialized at /home/ra/
- facts.md created, auto-loads via CLAUDE.md
- FIGGY backlog cleaned, principles + self-improvement loop adapted
- Journal system created at journal/2026/03.md
- Decision log upgraded to two-tier format (one-liner + ADR)
- PROJECT_LOG.md created (this file)
- Session closeout + trigger words added to EA CLAUDE.md
- Resume pulled from Drive -- needs AI-focused rewrite (parked until DuberyMNL done)
- Brand guidelines: none exist yet -- to be defined before WF2 scales up
- No public web presence for RA yet -- LinkedIn + GitHub needed post-DuberyMNL

### 2026-03-12 (Session 3 -- from work, day shift)
- Read both n8n workflows (Caption Generator + Image Generator) for full context
- Confirmed prompt format: labeled sections plain text (not NB2 JSON schema)
- Confirmed reference image mechanism: `image_input` Drive URLs passed to kie.ai API directly
- No Pillow overlay needed -- NB2 handles scene + all text + product via reference image
- Created dubery-caption-gen skill (WF1 CCO brain, 182 lines)
- Created dubery-prompt-writer skill (WF2 prompt composer, 233 lines)
- Both skills audited with skill-builder: frontmatter fixed, disable-model-invocation set
- DuberyMNL Content sheet (n8n) ID: 1OwWHwlhHfFgMMokMS3GGtH1fHptahbg2OscB07c8bkk (reference only)
- n8n workflows scrapped -- going full agentic (Claude Code as orchestrator)

### 2026-03-11 (Session 2 -- from work, night shift ~midnight)
- No DuberyMNL build work -- side session focused on EA personal tooling
- Discovered Google Workspace CLI (gws) v0.9.1 -- official Google tool, just released
- Installed gws CLI on home PC (`npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli`)
- Configured credentials.json (~/.config/gws/client_secret.json)
- Auth attempted -- blocked by OAuth localhost redirect not working via VSCode tunnel
- Parked: run `gws auth login` locally when home tonight
- Once authed: gws can access Gmail + Drive + Calendar + Docs from terminal (I operate it as EA)

- No public web presence for RA yet -- LinkedIn + GitHub needed post-DuberyMNL

### 2026-03-11 (Session 2 -- from work, night shift ~midnight)
- No DuberyMNL build work -- side session focused on EA personal tooling
- Discovered Google Workspace CLI (gws) v0.9.1 -- official Google tool, just released
- Installed gws CLI on home PC (`npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli`)
- Configured credentials.json (~/.config/gws/client_secret.json)
- Auth attempted -- blocked by OAuth localhost redirect not working via VSCode tunnel
- Parked: run `gws auth login` locally when home tonight
- Once authed: gws can access Gmail + Drive + Calendar + Docs from terminal (I operate it as EA)
